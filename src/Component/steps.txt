REACT WEATHER APP
Build a simple weather app that makes API calls to a weather service to display the current
weather for a given location
Here are the sample steps you can follow to build this app:
● Create a new React project using create-react-app.

● Create a function component for the app and import the useState and useEffect
hooks.

● Use the useState hook to create state variables for the city and the weather data.

● Create an input field for the user to enter a city and update the city state variable
using the onChange event.

● Use the useEffect hook to make an API call to a weather service when the city state
variable changes.

● Parse the data from the API response and update the weather data state variable.

● Display the current temperature, weather description, and any other relevant
information on the screen.
Feel free to use any approach… you don’t have to follow the steps i listed out above, because
there are many ways to achieve a particular thing but you’ll definitely find them useful
